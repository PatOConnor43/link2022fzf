## What is this?
These are my slides for a lightning talk I'm planning for an internal developer
conference called LINK.

## What is slides.md?
I like markdown and I don't really like WYSIWYG applications. For these slides I
decided to use a terminal application called
[slides](https://github.com/maaslalani/slides). This allows me to write the
slides in markdown. This makes it really easy to put in git and version control.

## Where can I find more information?
Relevant links are at the end of the presentation. You should find everything
you need there.
